if you are reading this go watch the disastrous life of Saiki K. its a slice of life/comedic anime about a near omnipoptent psychic teen who simply wants to blend in and live a boring life. But a hilarious cast of obsesive side characters always unknowingly make things as difficult as possible for him. The english dub is really good and theres only one season (ignore the netflix reboot its alright) but its fantastic and only gets funnier and funnier as more characters and lore are established. go watch it and if you read anymore of my README files i will leave recomendations for movies, shows, music or games. will anybody read it? i dont know but also who cares itll be funny if I or anyone else finds these
